This repository implements the training, testing and editing tools for "Visiting the Invisible:Layer-by-Layer Completed Scene Decomposition" by [Chuanxia Zheng](http://www.chuanxiaz.com), [Tat-Jen Cham](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/astjcham/) and [Jianfei Cai](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/asjfcai/) at NTU. Given one image, the proposed **CSDNet** model is able to structurally decompose the scene into scemantally completed instances, and background, while completing the RGB appearance for previously **invisible** regions.

## Example
